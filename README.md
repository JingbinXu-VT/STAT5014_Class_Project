# Team Name - Social Disparity

## Group members: Peter Crawford, Wenjun Han, Jingbin Xu

## Project Summary:
Do the rich really get richer, while the poor get poorer? This is an opinion among many Americans, but is it true? Our research project aims to shed insight on this commonly held belief and discover how different factors affect income. We will create a dashboard that summarizes our findings from U.S. socioeconomic data. Data will be gathered from the U.S. Census and a variety of other sources. The factors of which we are most interested are educational background, race, gender, and age. Additionally, we aim to see how the different factors' effects have changed throughout time and in which parts of the country (states/cities) they have been most prevelant.
